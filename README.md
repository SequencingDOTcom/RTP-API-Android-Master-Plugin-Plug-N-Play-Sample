# iOS Objective-C Master Plugin - Plug-n-Play Sample

This is a plug-n-play sample of the iOS (Objective-C) Master Plugin from Sequencing.com. It is a sample project example for Android with installed and integrated Master plugin via Gradle dependency manager.

This is 'plug-n-play' because this repo can be cloned and the code added to your app if you want to get up and running as quick as possible.

This sample works out of the box. To modify it to work with your apps:

* [Register](https://sequencing.com/user/register) for a free account at Sequencing.com
* Clone this repo and add the code to your app
* Swap the demo OAuth2 Secret with your OAuth2 secret generated when you are signed in to Sequencing.com. [Generate OAuth2 Secret](https://sequencing.com/developer-center/new-app-oauth-secret)
* Search and find one or more app chains you want your app to use. [Find App Chains](https://sequencing.com/app-chains)
* Change the App Chain "Chain#" with the Chain# you want to use.
* Configure your app based on the possible responses to your selected App Chain(s). 
 * Most app chains are just a simple "Yes" or "No" response.
